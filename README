A transformation tool between traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese in Python.

There some limitations or bugs in Opencc (https://code.google.com/p/opencc/) or pyjft (https://code.google.com/p/pyjft/). So I integrate some codes and develop this transformation tool.

Function: Transform traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese or transform simplified Chinese to traditional Chinese.

Description: Use a traditional Chinese dictionary and a corresponding simplified Chinese dictionary.

Addition: If you find the tradition Chinese dictionary is insufficiency, you can add some words youself (remeber to add the corresponding simplified word in the simplified dictionary).

Advantages:
    1. It transforms a string or a file word by word, so the string or a file can include other languages' characters.
    2. It allows the mixing of traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese.
